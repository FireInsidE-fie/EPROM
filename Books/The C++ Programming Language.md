## Chapter 1 - Notes to the reader
### Section 1.3.3 - Suggestions for C Programmers
Some nice advice coming from a [[C]] background. Do NOT think that C++ is just C with ++features. It's a different language completely, treat it as such.
### Section 1.4 - History of C++

> [!NOTE] Reading to be done!
> Pretty interesting though not particularly relevant to using the language.

### Section 1.5 - Advice
Some good general advice as you start learning the language (and even just every time you need a refresher).
## Chapter 44 - Compatibility
Differences between C and C++ and all the standards over the years.
Page 1272 has a cool diagram displaying the evolution of C and C++ in parallel over the years.

# Personal thoughts
still very much reading it, but this look like the "The C++ book" TM. Just like rust has its book, though this one is definitely more reference than book (or is it?)
