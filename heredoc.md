In [[bash]], heredocs are a type of redirections of sorts. You use them like `less << EOF`, where [[less]] is the command, and << EOF is the heredoc itself. What it does is effectively replace the input [[file descriptor]] from less with the input from the heredoc. It calls [[readline()]] until EOF, the delimiter, is found as a complete line, then ends the heredoc and send the entire input to the command.
