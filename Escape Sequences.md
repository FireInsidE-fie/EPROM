In [[C]] and [[C++]], you have things called escape sequences for unprintable characters that you might still want to use in your code in string literals, for example.

> [!TODO] Formatting to be done!

Here's a list:
Name	Symbol	Meaning
Alert	\a	Makes an alert, such as a beep
Backspace	\b	Moves the cursor back one space
Formfeed	\f	Moves the cursor to next logical page
Newline	\n	Moves cursor to next line
Carriage return	\r	Moves cursor to beginning of line
Horizontal tab	\t	Prints a horizontal tab
Vertical tab	\v	Prints a vertical tab
Single quote	\’	Prints a single quote
Double quote	\”	Prints a double quote
Backslash	\\	Prints a backslash.
Question mark	\?	Prints a question mark.
No longer relevant. You can use question marks unescaped.
Octal number	\(number)	Translates into char represented by octal
Hex number	\x(number)	Translates into char represented by hex number
