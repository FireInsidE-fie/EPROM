The Bourne Again SHell `bash`, the GNU [[Shell]] that's usable on basically all unix systems.
An interactive command interpreter AND a programming language too.
Initially created for the [[GNU Project]], and still maintained by the [[Free Software Foundation]] to this day.
It was designed to be a 100% free alternative to the Bourne Shell ([[sh]]).
# Shell scripts
Bash is capable of interpreting `.sh` files containing raw commands usually executed within Bash itself, allowing for complex scripts executing repetitive tasks or automation.
