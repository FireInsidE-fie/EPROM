The Orthodox Canonical Form is a set of guidelines for building classes that are easy to use and simple to clean.
The idea is to always have classes that have :
- A default [[Constructor]] (for default values), a copy [[Constructor]] (for assigning a [[Class]]' values to a copy of itself), an assignment operator (to assign the object's values to another) and a destructor (to clean it all up afterwards).
