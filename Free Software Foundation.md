A non-profit organization founded by [[Richard Stallman]] in 1985.
It supports the free software movement, hellbent on using only free software in everything they do.
They enforce what's called "copyleft", which basically means (under the GNU General Public LIcense) that you are to publish every modification to their code and also publish any application that makes use of it.
They also have a few other free software licenses that they edict.

They are the primary copyright holders of the [[GNU Project]], such as its compiler collection (including [[gcc]]).
