## 0 - Introduction
### 0.1
Don't code when you're tired or stressed out. Sort out the things that stress you out or go sleep or something. Then come back and write good code.
Tired/stressed out programmers often write bad code. Sometimes they don't, but most of the time they do. **You aren't that guy.**
### 0.2
> Platforms often provide useful services for the programs running on them. For example, a desktop application might request the operating system give them a chunk of free memory, create a file over there, or play a sound. The running program doesn’t have to know how this is actually facilitated. If a program uses capabilities or services provided by the platform, it becomes dependent on that platform, and cannot be run on other platforms without modification. A program that can be easily transferred from one platform to another is said to be **portable**. The act of modifying a program so that it runs on a different platform is called **porting**.

> Some cool info to be added to [[Assembly]].
> An **assembly language** (often called **assembly** for short) is a programming language that essentially functions as a more human-readable machine language.
> Just like each CPU family has its own machine language, each CPU family also has its own assembly language (which is designed to be assembled into machine language for that same CPU family). This means there are many different assembly languages. Although conceptually similar, different assembly languages support different instructions, use different naming conventions, etc…

> Some cool info to be added to [[Interpreter]].
> Alternatively, an **interpreter** is a program that directly executes the instructions in the source code without requiring them to be compiled first. Interpreters tend to be more flexible than compilers, but are less efficient when running programs because the interpreting process needs to be done every time the program is run. This also means the interpreter must be installed on every machine where an interpreted program will be run.
> A good comparison of the advantages of compilers vs interpreters can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38491646).
### 0.4
Take some time to design solutions to problems before diving right in. Go to the drawing board, so to say, and conceptualize.
Maybe make an Obsidian Canvas.
Defining the problem is just as important as designing as solution.
On how to design good solutions to problems :
> Typically, good solutions have the following characteristics:
- They are straightforward (not overly complicated or confusing).
- They are well documented (especially around any assumptions being made or limitations).
- They are built modularly, so parts can be reused or changed later without impacting other parts of the program.
- They can recover gracefully or give useful error messages when something unexpected happens.\

> When you sit down and start coding right away, you’re typically thinking “I want to do ”, so you implement the solution that gets you there the fastest. This can lead to programs that are fragile, hard to change or extend later, or have lots of bugs.
## 1 - C++ Basics
### 1.2 - Comments
There are several types of comments, like the [[Doxygen]] comments found at a function's start for librairies, or the inline comments for specific parts of the code.

> [!WARNING] Good and bad comments
> In general, you'll want as a rule to not so much describe what's happening (what is already understandable by just reading the code), but rather explain **why** a line of code is the way it is.

You can also use comments to explain why a certain approach was used and not another. This prevents you from coming back to your code after a while and going "well why didn't we do it that way?".

> [!SUCCESS] Best practice
> Comment your code liberally, and write your comments as if speaking to someone who has no idea what the code does. Don’t assume you’ll remember why you made specific choices.
> - At the library, program, or function level, use comments to describe _what_.
> - Inside the library, program, or function, use comments to describe _how_.
> - At the statement level, use comments to describe _why_.
### 1.4
Apparently in [[C++]], initialization of variables is a whole thing. It's not just about saying `x = 4` anymore, you can do crazy stuff with braces, parentheseses and more.
### 1.5
Keep in mind `std::cout` is buffered, which means some output might only appear past a certain point.
`std::cin` is also buffer, which is how C++ extracts variables from the input in cases like `std::cin >> x`.
If there's still valid input in the `cin` buffer, it will extract that value instead of prompting the user for input.
For example, if you want to extract two values, even if there are `std::cin >> x` and `std::cin >> y` on separate lines, if your input contains `4 5`, you'll only have to press enter once for both variables to be filled with 4 and 5 respectively.
> `std::cin` is buffered because it allows us to separate the entering of input from the extract of input. We can enter input once and then perform multiple extraction requests on it.
> Here’s a simplified view of how operator `>>` works for input.
> 1. If `std::cin` is not in a good state (e.g. the prior extraction failed and `std::cin` has not yet been cleared), no extraction is attempted, and the extraction process aborts immediately.
> 2. Leading whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, and newlines at the front of the buffer) are discarded from the input buffer. This will discard an unextracted newline character remaining from a prior line of input.
> 3. If the input buffer is now empty, operator `>>` will wait for the user to enter more data. Any leading whitespace is discarded from the entered data.
> 4. operator `>>` then extracts as many consecutive characters as it can, until it encounters either a newline character (representing the end of the line of input) or a character that is not valid for the variable being extracted to.

> [!ERROR] Failed extractions
> If an extraction fails, the input buffer will be pretty much unusable until it is completely cleared (flushed).
### 1.8
Adopt the style of the project you're currently working in, if it's not yours. Better to work with consistency than with whatever you happen to prefer.
Learn to use your IDE's formatting features so you keep a consistent formatting throughout your project(s). [[clang-format]] is pretty good.
### 1.9
A function is said to have a **side effect** when it does more than just return a value. It could for example modify its arguments, or some other static variable elsewhere.
They aren't a bad thing as the name would suggest, just a way to use and design functions.
### 1.11
Theory crafting a program before getting to start coding it is a good thing, but remember that **you need to write a program once to know how you should have written it in the first place**.
In other words, you will very probably not be able to produce a perfect result first try.
The best way to find how you should write something is to just write it : you'll find the problems with your approach easier that way, rather than staying in front of the white board waiting for the light to illuminate your thoughts.
**Perfection in programming is an iterative process.**

## 2 - Functions
### 2.2
Use `EXIT_SUCCESS` and `EXIT_FAILURE` instead of your own return statuses for the `main()` function. (they're defined in `<stdlib>` btw)
### 2.5
Locality of behavior : **try to define your variables as close to the place they're used as possible**.
Difference between objects and identifiers : identifiers hold the scope (and name) of an object. An identifier tagged onto an object makes a variable.
### 2.6
Remember that **functions should always do one specific task only**.
### 2.9
Do not use `using` directives, since they're here only for including namespaces' entire symbols, it negates the entire point of namespaces. Just don't use them.
### 2.10
It's the pre-processor's job to clean the code for the compilation stage (removing the comments, processing include directives, etc...)
A **translation unit** is a source file after it has been pre-processed.
### 2.11
Source files that have a paired header should include said header.
c++ standard headers are usually in the `<xxx>` format like `<iostream>`, and c standard headers are usually `<xxx.h>` like `<stdio.h>`.
Of course, user defined headers are still formatted like "xxx.h", just like in C.
Some standard headers include other standard headers. **Don't forget to include all headers you need explicitly.**
### [2.13](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/how-to-design-your-first-programs/)
Some great advice on how to design programs and prepare game plans for them before starting to code.
**Break hard problems into small, easier problems.** This advice is also useful when making todo lists.
Don't optimize at the micro level, like a few statements at a time. Optimization is better for maintainability than performance, and a well structured program is better optimized **by design**.
> A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked
—John Gall, Systemantics: How Systems Really Work and How They Fail p. 71

***THE DESIGN STAGE IS VERY IMPORTANT***
## 3 - Debugging
### 3.4
When printf debugging in C++, use `cerr` instead of `cout`. Since `cout` is buffered, it might not output what you want in time (or at all if the program crashes).
### 3.5
There's also `clog` for extended logging capabilities. By default, it writes to stderr but you might find better uses of it with a dedicated logger library.
> Plog is implemented as a set of header files, so it’s easy to include anywhere you need it, and it’s lightweight and easy to use.
### 3.6
```cpp
std::cout << std::unitbuf; // enable automatic flushing for std::cout (for debugging)
```
### 3.7
"set next statement" is a debugger command a bit akin to a goto call, basically makes the execution point jump to another line in the program. You could even go backwards with this little beauty.
### 3.8
Some debuggers allow you to set a breakpoint on a watched variable, which means the execution will be stopped everytime the variable changes.
### 3.9
The Call Stack is the trace of all functions that have been called up until a specific point in execution.
### 3.10
**Defensive programming** is the practice of trying to predict all user misinputs or misuses and mitigating the errors that would be produced (for example inputting alphabetical characters where numbers are expected).
Some good static analysis tools: 
- [clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) (you have that in CLion btw)
- [cpplint](https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint)
- [cppcheck](https://cppcheck.sourceforge.io/) (already integrated into Code::Blocks)
- [SonarLint](https://www.sonarsource.com/open-source-editions/)
## 4 - Fundamental data types
### 4.1
**Integral types** are fundamental types that are stored in memory as integers, but don't necessarily display as integers when you print them out (booleans).
### 4.2
**Incomplete types** are types that the compiler cannot figure out a size in bytes just yet.
`void` is the best example.
> [!WARNING] Functions that don't take any arguments
> Unlike in C, the used of `function(void)` to specify that a function doesn't take any arguments is deprecated in C++.
### 4.3
The `sizeof` operator is an operator, not a function, despite what the syntax would lead you to believe.
It cannot be used for dynamically allocated memory.
### 4.4
When dividing two integers, the result will also be an integer. In effect, the decimal part is simply dropped. NO rounding.
### 4.5
You don't need this much optimization to use unsigned integers instead of signed ones. Just use signed integers with everything you do, mkay? When you need more optimization (in cases with thousands of variables, for example), you'll see it and be able to use fixed-width integers.
### 4.6
TLDR : fixed width integers are nice. Use them.
Also use `<cstddef>` for including `size_t`, it's the smallest header that contains it.
>- Prefer int when the size of the integer doesn’t matter (e.g. the number will always fit within the range of a 2-byte signed integer). For example, if you’re asking the user to enter their age, or counting from 1 to 10, it doesn’t matter whether int is 16-bits or 32-bits (the numbers will fit either way). This will cover the vast majority of the cases you’re likely to run across.
>- Prefer std::int_t when storing a quantity that needs a guaranteed range.
>- Prefer std::uint_t when doing bit manipulation or well-defined wrap-around behavior is required (e.g. for cryptography or random number generation).
>Avoid the following when possible:
>- short and long integers (prefer a fixed-width integer type instead).
>- The fast and least integral types (prefer a fixed-width integer type instead).
>- Unsigned types for holding quantities (prefer a signed integer type instead).
>- The 8-bit fixed-width integer types (prefer a 16-bit fixed-width integer type instead).
>- Any compiler-specific fixed-width integers (for example, Visual Studio defines \_\_int8, \_\_int16, etc…)
### [4.7](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-scientific-notation/)
A good scientific notation round up.
Significant digits are the digits that are needed to not lose any information about a number. That includes both digits before and after the decimal point.
### 4.8
`double` is double the precision of the `float`. Basically double the digits after the decimal point (I think).
When assigning with a literal, `x = 3.0` will assume x is a `double`, while `x = 3.0f` assumes a `float` type.
> The precision of a floating point type defines how many significant digits it can represent without information loss.

`std::setprecisions()` allows you to set the precision at which `std::cout` will output floating point variables and literals.
When trying to store a number with 10 significant digits in a type with only 7 digit precision, you end up losing on 3 digits of precision. This applies to not only fractional numbers, but also numbers that are too big for a float could lose some of their precision too (123456789.0f becoming 123456792, for example).
> **Favor double over float unless space is at a premium, as the lack of precision in a float will often lead to inaccuracies.**

Due to the way floating numbers are stored in binary format, even simple numbers such as 0.1 will be stored in a way that loses precision.
In the end, 0.1 is actually something like 0.10000000000000001.
Because of all of this, beware of using floating numbers for critical data like finances or currency stuff, as repeated operations will increase the rounding error that occurs.
### 4.12
Casting in c++ is done via `static_cast`, with the syntax `static_cast<new_type>(expression)`.
Things in angled brackets `<>` are very often types.
## 5 - Constants and Strings
### 5.1
If a variable can be made const, do it. It helps the compiler optimize.
### 5.2
The f character found after float literals like `2.0f` are actually part of a plethora of literal values suffixes. There's one for almost every type out there, but the float one is pretty much the only one you'll use.
### [5.3](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/numeral-systems-decimal-binary-hexadecimal-and-octal/)
Primer on numerical systems like binary, hexadecimal and octal.
Use a `0` prefix on number literals to make them octal literals.
Use a `0x` prefix on number literals to make them hexadecimal literals.
### 5.4
**Profilers** are programs that analyse a program and tells which parts of it takes the longest time to run, or which are impacting performance the most.
> Compile-time evaluation allows the compiler to do work at compile-time that would otherwise be done at runtime. Because such expressions no longer need to be evaluated at runtime, the resulting executables are faster and smaller (at the cost of slightly slower compilation times).
### 5.5
The `constexpr` type modifier asks for an expression to be evaluated at compile-time.
Constant expressions (not the keyword, we mean literals, variables etc that do not change) must be evaluatable at compile-time.
> The compiler is only _required_ to evaluate constant expressions at compile-time in contexts that _require_ a constant expression. It may or may not do so in other cases.

Floats and doubles aren't compile-time constant expressions, because they aren't integrals.
### 5.6
`const` variables are values that cannot be changed after initialization.
`constexpr` variables are values that can be used in constant expressions.
### 5.7
Use `std::string` instead of `char *` when working with strings in C++.
When trying to get a full string as input from `cin`, use `std::getline` (it will keep reading input until a new line is found, which means whitespace is ignored, unlike with `cin`)
Get the length of an `std::string` with the `.length()` member function
Since `std::string` is basically a glorified `char *`, don't pass it by value, pass it by reference (it's expensive to copy a whole string)
You could also use `std::string_view` arguments in functions to prevent passing in the `std::string` directly.
Same thing with returning `std::string` from a function. You can, but try to alloc it and return a pointer to it instead.
### 5.8
`std::string_view` is basically a read-only variable representing a string value.
It's easier to move around and pass by value, so use that whenever you need a read-only string.
Since those are "views", I guess you could kinda see it like a string pointer. It "watches" a string, and if you assign it a new string, instead of modifying the watched string, it just switches the string it's currently watching.
`std::string_view` has full support for `constexpr`.
### 5.9
> In programming, when we call an object an owner, we generally mean that it is the sole owner (unless otherwise specified). Sole ownership (also called single ownership) ensures it is clear who has responsibility for that data.

A view is a read-only representation of an object. It's fine for multiple views of an object to exist. And it's way less expensive to copy. (probably a pointer to the memory being viewed under the hood?)
You can create functions that take a `string_view` as a parameter, for example, and pass it `string`s without any issue. The implicit conversion will create a view of that `string` variable.
> [!WARNING]
> A view is dependent on the object being viewed. If the object being viewed is modified or destroyed while the view is still being used, unexpected or undefined behavior will result.
> Do not initialize a `std::string_view` with a `std::string` literal, as this will leave the `std::string_view` dangling.

> [!ERROR] Modifying the underlying string
> If you modify the string a `string_view` watches, that also breaks the view (since the memory is reallocated somewhere else, the pointer becomes invalid).
> You'll need to reassign it to the `string_view`, or assign it a new string instead.

`std::string_view` can view sub-strings, including removing both a suffix and a prefix if wanted.
This allows you to manipulate sub-strings without making copies of the initial string.
**Not all string views are null-terminated because of this.**
This isn't that big of an issue because string views also have a `.length()` member function you can use instead of looping until the null character.

> [!EXAMPLE] When to use `std::string` or `std::string_view`
> Use a `std::string` variable when:
> - You need a string that you can modify.
> - You need to store user-inputted text.
> - You need to store the return value of a function that returns a `std::string`.
> 
> Use a `std::string_view` variable when:
> - You need read-only access to part or all of a string that already exists elsewhere and will not be modified or destroyed before use of the `std::string_view` is complete.
> - You need a symbolic constant for a C-style string.
> - You need to continue viewing the return value of a function that returns a C-style string or a non-dangling `std::string_view`.

Use redundant parentheses to make it clear what you're doing.
It's better to be clearer with more of them than to be unclear and have to look up this table each time you have doubts about what you were doing.
**Multiple operators on a single line will be evaluated in a different order depending on the [[Compiler]] used.**
### 6.2
When using `operator/` to divide numbers, it will do floating point division only if at least one of the two numbers are floats.
That means that just dividing `5 / 2` will result in `2`, not `2.5`. You'll have to `static_cast` either of them to get a floating result.
### 6.4
When it's not important to the program features, favor `++i` instead of `i++`. It's supposed to be faster.
### 6.7
Don't use exact comparison operators `==` and `!=` when comparing calculated floating point values.
This is because of floating point errors.
To compare calculated floats more precisely, use an epsilon value to determine the margin you're willing to accept.
Try to get a relative epsilon (like a tiny percentage of error margin).

## 7 - Namespaces
### 7.2
You can create namespaces using this syntax :
namespace NamespaceIdentifier
```cpp
namespace NamespaceIdentifier {
    // content of namespace here
}
```
Use `::` without a namespace before it to access the global namespace.
Useful to access the global namespace from inside another one.
Both forward declarations and definition of functions have to be inside of the namespace block.
That also means you can declare the same namescape across multiple header and source files, and everything inside those blocks will be under the same namescape.
### 7.3
An object having linkage means that if it is re-declared in a different scope it will refer to the same object.
### 7.4
Define global variables in a namespace instead of in the global namespace.
Also keep using prefixes for globals like `g_`.
Global variables are like static variables, initialized to 0 by default at the very start of the program.
In general, **just don't use globals**.
### 7.6
An identifier having **internal linkage** means it's only accessible from a single translation unit (or source file).
An identifier having **external linkage** means it is accessible from other files as well.
A good example of this is functions: adding a `static` in front of a declaration prevents it from being accessible in other files.
It's the same for global variables.
`const` and `constexpr` have internal linkage by default.
### 7.7
To make an external linkage identifier or function accessible to another file, you'll need to forward declare it (either in the file or in a header you'll include).
Import global variables from other files with the `extern` keyword with forward declarations.
Make global variables accessible from other files with the same keyword.
