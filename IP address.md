Every device using the [[Internet Protocol]] is assigned a unique IP address to distinguish them from others.
# Subnet mask
IP addresses are "divided" into two parts, one identifies the network of the host, the other, the host itself.
In TCP/IP ([[Transmission Control Protocol]] over [[Internet Protocol]]), this is called the subnet mask.
The CIDR determines the number of 1-bits found in the subnet mask, and thus its size.
By using the CIDR, you can determine the number of subnets found in a network.
These are small independant networks; hosts need to be in the same subnet to communicate directly.

# IPv4
A 32-bit number divided into 4 blocks that go from 0 to 255.
Example : `192.168.1.1`
# IPv6

> [!NOTE] Research to be done!

# Reserved networks
Some networks are usually only used in cases of a private, internal network (your home wifi for example).
- `10.0.0.0` - `10.255.255.255`
- `172.16.0.0` - `172.31.255.255`
- `192.168.0.0` - `192.168.255.255`
They provide enough distinct addresses to be used without problems inside of a single, private network.
# Loopback addresses
There's a range of IP addresses specifically reserved for internal testing and communications within a single device.
Its range is `127.0.0.0` - `127.255.255.255`.
The `127.0.0.1` is referred to as `localhost`, and represents the device itself.
